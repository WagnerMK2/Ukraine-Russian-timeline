Laying works were completed in July 2008 by the American cable ship CS _Tyco Decisive_, just a couple of weeks prior to the South Ossetia War.[[4]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Cable_System#cite_note-4) The submarine cable was manufactured and laid by [TE Connectivity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TE_Connectivity "TE Connectivity") and consists of two fiber pairs each carrying 96 wavelengths with a bandwidth of 100Gbit/s providing a total bandwidth of 12.8Tbit/s (originally 64 × 10Gbit/s and a total of 1.2Tbit/s).[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Cable_System#cite_note-seenews-2)[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Cable_System#cite_note-CCS-1) In 2011 an upgrade implemented by TE Connectivity enabled the addition of further wavelengths.[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Cable_System#cite_note-TE_subcom-5)
