**May 8: United States**

Announces new sanctions on Russia, targeting executive board members of Sberbank and members of Gazprombank JSC's board of directors. The new sanctions also target JSC Bank Moscow Industrial Bank, among other entities. In addition, three of Russia's top state-owned and/or controlled TV networks have been added to the sanctions list: JSC Channel One Russia, television station Russia-1 and JSC NTV Broadcasting Co. The move is intended to block the sale of equipment to the broadcasters and cut off any U.S.-originated advertising revenue from being funneled back to the Russian state.
